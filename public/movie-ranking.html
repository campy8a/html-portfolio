<hr />
<h3>Openheimer</h3>
<p>The history of the atomic bomb, showing all of its process. Almost shows you the excitement and fear of its creators.</p>

<p>A journey to the subconscious of the mind, another Nolan movie that keeps you on the edge and thinking long after leaving the cinema</p>
<h3>The Lion King (1994) </h3>
<p>The best representation of Hamlet for the kids, thanks to disney with memorable songs and moments we remember 'till today</p>
